# Usage Notes for Claude Code:
#
# 1. NEVER add data to this file without explicit user confirmation
# 2. When working on SEO/marketing materials, ALWAYS read this file first
# 3. If a field is null or false, DO NOT include it in website/structured data
# 4. Before adding any social proof data, ask user: "Is this verified and real?"
# 5. This file should be updated only when REAL milestones are achieved
#
# Example scenarios:
# - User says "we got 1000 downloads!" → Ask: "Should I update metrics.total_downloads to 1000?"
# - Working on SEO → Read this file → Only use features/data that exist here
# - Creating structured data → Check reviews.has_reviews before adding AggregateRating
