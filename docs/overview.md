# ExcelViewer - Project Overview

## What It Does

ExcelViewer is a desktop application for comparing and analyzing Excel files. It's built with .NET 8 and Avalonia UI to work on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The application processes everything locally—no cloud uploads, no external dependencies.

## Why It Exists

Many professionals in finance, healthcare, and government work with sensitive data that cannot be sent to online services. Existing Excel comparison tools are either too basic, cloud-based, or expensive enterprise solutions. ExcelViewer fills the gap by providing professional-grade comparison features while keeping all data processing on your machine.

## Target Users

Professionals who work with sensitive Excel data and need secure, local processing:

- Financial analysts working with confidential models
- Government contractors handling classified information
- Healthcare professionals processing HIPAA-protected data
- Legal teams managing privileged documents
- Manufacturing engineers protecting trade secrets

## Current Status

The application has a working foundation with core features implemented:

- ✅ **Excel file loading**: Full support for .xlsx files with proper parsing
- ✅ **Search functionality**: Advanced search across files with hierarchical results display
- ✅ **Row comparison**: Select search results and compare complete rows side-by-side
- ✅ **Professional UI**: Modern interface with light/dark themes and responsive design
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Native performance on Windows, Linux, and macOS

### Next Development Phase

- Export capabilities (HTML, PDF, Excel)
- Performance optimization for large files
- Advanced comparison algorithms
- Batch processing capabilities
- API for automation

### Future Features

- Integration with version control systems
- Multi-user collaboration tools
- Audit trail and compliance reporting
- Enterprise authentication (SSO)
- Custom reporting templates

## Competitive Advantage

1. **Security First**: 100% local processing, no cloud dependencies
2. **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface built with Avalonia
3. **Cross-Platform**: Native performance on Windows, Linux, macOS
4. **Industry Focus**: Features tailored for compliance and data sensitivity
5. **Professional Grade**: Enterprise-ready with proper licensing and support

## Technology Stack

- **Core**: .NET 8, C# 12
- **UI Framework**: Avalonia UI with MVVM pattern
- **Excel Processing**: DocumentFormat.OpenXml
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Core/Infrastructure/UI layers)
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Logging**: Microsoft.Extensions.Logging with structured logging
- **Testing**: xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions
- **Version Control**: Git with develop branch workflow
- **Packaging**: Self-contained deployments for each platform

## Technical Goals

- File processing speed: <1 second for 10MB files
- Cross-platform compatibility: 100% feature parity
- Crash rate: <0.1%
- Memory efficiency: <500MB for largest files
- User satisfaction: >90% positive feedback

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Avalonia maturity**: Mitigation through thorough testing
- **Excel compatibility**: Extensive file format testing
- **Performance on large files**: Streaming and optimization

## Development Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete Avalonia UI infrastructure
2. ✅ Implement core comparison and search features
3. Add export capabilities (HTML, PDF, Excel)
4. Performance optimization for large files
5. Enhanced error handling and user feedback
6. Comprehensive testing and bug fixes
